# Build and push to minikube local image
```
```

In situations where all that is needed to build a container image and no push to a registry is necessary (essentially by having set quarkus.container-image.build=true and left quarkus.container-image.push unset - it defaults to false), then this extension creates a container image and registers it with the Docker daemon. This means that although Docker isnâ€™t used to build the image, it is nevertheless necessary. Also note that using this mode, the built container image will show up when executing docker images.
