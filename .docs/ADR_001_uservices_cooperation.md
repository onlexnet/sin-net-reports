# ADR 001: Uservices Cooperation

## Context
We are going to have multiple uservices, tested locally and deployed later on to k8s

## Decision
- We decided to go with Entity DAPR.

## Alternatives considered:
- Spring Cloud stack: widely used, java-based

## Reason
- Subjective decision

## Consequences
- New tools to learn, as DAPR is not widely used by organizations
