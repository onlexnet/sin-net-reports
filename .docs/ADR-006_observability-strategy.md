Context: SinNet Reports microservices application needs comprehensive observability covering traces, metrics, logs, and user monitoring across React frontend and Java Spring Boot backend services

Decision: We decided to use Azure Application Insights as the unified observability platform

Solutions:
- **Application Insights**: Native Azure integration with automatic instrumentation for Java and JavaScript SDKs. Provides end-to-end tracing, user tracking, performance monitoring, and log aggregation
- **OpenTelemetry OTLP**: Vendor-neutral observability with OTLP collectors and exporters. Would require additional infrastructure setup and configuration complexity
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Separate metrics collection with custom dashboards. Would duplicate functionality already available in Application Insights

Reason: Application Insights provides zero-configuration integration with Azure Container Apps, automatic log forwarding from containers, native Java agent auto-instrumentation, React SDK with user tracking, and cost-effective unified platform for all observability needs. OpenTelemetry would add complexity without significant benefits for Azure-native deployment

Consequences: 
- **Positive**: Automatic instrumentation with minimal code changes, end-to-end distributed tracing from React to database, email-based user journey tracking, native Azure integration with zero-config log forwarding, single tool for traces/metrics/logs/alerts
- **Negative**: Vendor lock-in with Azure ecosystem, limited customization compared to OpenTelemetry flexibility, dependency on GitHub Secrets for connection string management
- **Implementation**: Frontend uses `@microsoft/applicationinsights-web` v3.3.4 with automatic route tracking and authenticated user context. Backend uses Application Insights Java Agent v3.7.4 with Spring Boot buildpack configuration (`BPE_PREPEND_JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`). Infrastructure uses Terraform to provision Application Insights resource and distribute connection strings via Container Apps environment variables

Notes:
- Java agent is downloaded during build process and activated via buildpack environment variables
- Connection string is distributed from Terraform → KeyVault → Container Apps for backend, and GitHub Secrets → CI/CD → runtime-config.json for frontend
- Automatic correlation between React user actions, GraphQL queries, gRPC calls, and database operations
- Log forwarding: Console output → Container Apps → Log Analytics Workspace → Application Insights
- Current status: Infrastructure and SDK integration complete, agent activation configured, alerting rules and dashboards pending
